# Dapp

A decentralized application (DApp, dApp, Dapp, or dapp) is a computer application that runs on a decentralized computing system.

#### Characteristics

* DApps have their backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, as opposed to typical applications where the backend code is running on centralized servers.
* A DApp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language that can make calls to its backend.
* Furthermore, its frontend can be hosted on decentralized storage such as Swarm or IPFS. (The InterPlanetary File System is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices)
* DApps are typically open-source, decentralized, incentivized through providing tokens to those who validate the DApp, and in compliance with a specific protocol agreed upon within the community.
* DApps may run on top of distributed computing systems such as Ethereum or Bitcoin. Decentralized applications are stored on and executed by a blockchain system.

#### DeFi DApps

DApps have been utilized in decentralized finance (DeFi), which revolves around dapps that perform financial functions on blockchains, a technology that was invented for Bitcoin but has since caught on more broadly.

DeFi DApps allow users to:

* Lend or borrow funds from others.
* Go long or short on a range of assets.
* Trade coins or earn interest in a savings-like account without a centralized intermediary.

#### DApp Browsers

All the DApps have a unique code that may only work on a specific platform. 
Not all DApps work on traditional browsers like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. 
Some of them only work on special websites with a customized code, adjusted to open certain DApps
